# ☕ Java Learnings — From Basics to Building

Welcome to my Java learning repository 👋  
This repo documents my journey of learning **core Java by building projects**, not just reading theory.

The focus here is simple:
> **Understand logic → write clean code → use Git properly**

---

## 🚀 What this repository is about

- Learning **Java fundamentals** the right way
- Practicing **logic, control flow, and problem solving**
- Building **small but meaningful projects**
- Using **Git branches, commits, and pull requests** like a real developer

This repo will **evolve over time** as I move into:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Better structured projects
- More real-world Java applications

## 📂 Mini Projects Included

These projects were built in increasing order of difficulty 👇

| # | Project | Concepts Practiced |
|---|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Weight Converter | Input, methods, math |
| 2 | Temperature Converter | Formulas, switch-case |
| 3 | Calculator | Operators, loops, methods |
| 4 | Dice Roller | Random numbers, loops |
| 5 | Number Guessing Game | Conditions, hints, loops |
| 6 | Rock Paper Scissors | Game logic, methods |
| 7 | Quiz Game | Arrays, scoring system |
| 8 | Banking Program | State, menus, methods |
| 9 | Slot Machine | Randomness, state, nested logic |

Each project was developed in its **own Git branch** and merged back to `main` using proper Git workflows.
